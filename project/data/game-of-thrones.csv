" Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?",Robert Baratheon,e3-Lord Snow,season-01,Game-of-Thrones

Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories.

"  If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices : pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.",Jorah Mormont,e3-Lord Snow,season-01,Game-of-Thrones

They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it.

" When I was 12, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death.

 It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?,MARGAERY,e2-Dark Wings Dark Words,season-03,Game-of-Thrones

" As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.

I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed.

 What was it like?,MARGAERY,e3-Breaker of Chains,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.,OLENNA,e3-Breaker of Chains,season-04,Game-of-Thrones

 Holiness?,TOMMEN,e3-Breaker of Chains,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.,TYWIN,e3-Breaker of Chains,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 Justice.,TOMMEN,e3-Breaker of Chains,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long.

" Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years.

So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing.

 Wisdom.,TOMMEN,e3-Breaker of Chains,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 Yes!,TYWIN,e3-Breaker of Chains,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 Wisdom is what makes a good king.,TOMMEN,e3-Breaker of Chains,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?,TYWIN,e3-Breaker of Chains,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 No.,TOMMEN,e3-Breaker of Chains,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
" No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?",TYWIN,e3-Breaker of Chains,season-04,Game-of-Thrones

 The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.,HOT PIE,e7-Mockingbird,season-04,Game-of-Thrones

 Your sister.,OBERYN,e7-Mockingbird,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 Oh.,TYRION,e7-Mockingbird,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
  Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.,OBERYN,e7-Mockingbird,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.,TYRION,e7-Mockingbird,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.,OBERYN,e7-Mockingbird,season-04,Game-of-Thrones

 You and my family have more in common than you might admit.,TYRION,e7-Mockingbird,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
" The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.",OBERYN,e7-Mockingbird,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
 That would have made things so much easier.,TYRION,e7-Mockingbird,season-04,Game-of-Thrones
" When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long.""",OBERYN,e7-Mockingbird,season-04,Game-of-Thrones

 What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?,ROBIN,e7-Mockingbird,season-04,Game-of-Thrones

In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it.

 In a hurry? You're afraid?,DAARIO,e2,season-05,Game-of-Thrones

He pats Grey Worm on the shoulder. The Unsullied soldier grabs the man. Grey Worm searches the hiding place and finds daggers laying on the ground with a Sons of the Harpy mask.,,e2,season-05,Game-of-Thrones

" I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us.

 I'm not my father.,DAENERYS,e2,season-05,Game-of-Thrones
" No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end.",BARRISTAN,e2,season-05,Game-of-Thrones

I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They’re nasty little shits.

I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, (Shireen smiles), and you pressed it to your cheek. (Looks down. Shireen’s smile drops). By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it). I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. (Turns to her). Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. (Shireen smiles). I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life.

And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.

A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.",TYRION,e4,season-05,Game-of-Thrones

 He was good?,DAENERYS,e4,season-05,Game-of-Thrones

The Unsullied enter a corridor, expecting to catch the sons. Instead, they themselves are ambushed from every direction by Sons of the Harpy. After a tense few moments, a fight breaks out. During the fight, one of the Unsullied’s helmet is knocked off, and is revealed to be Grey Worm. Another fight breaks out elsewhere. The two Unsullied there are killed almost immediately. Barristan walks down an alley and, upon noticing the chaos, heads to the fighting. Grey Worm is badly injured, and with his party killed, also badly outnumbered. Unsullied are shown being killed elsewhere. Grey Worm continues holding off the sons, and Barristan arrives to assist him. They are able to kill all of the sons, but are both seriously injured in the process.

" When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.",TYRION,e8,season-05,Game-of-Thrones

They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can’t stop them. The Night’s Watch can’t stop them. And all the southern kings can’t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight.",JON,e8,season-05,Game-of-Thrones

Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order.,TYRION,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 What does that mean?,YEZZAN,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

TYRION and company reach the bottom of the steps so they are face to face with the men.,,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 You are a stranger here. So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?,MAN #1,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels --,TYRION,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 When does she return?,MAN #2,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Soon. You have my word.,TYRION,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

 You are wrong to trust these men.,GREY WORM,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

KEVIN and LADY OLENNA stand up.,,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You’re not welcome.,LADY OLENNA,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals.,CERSEI,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What’s left to work with?",LADY OLENNA,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king’s ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.,JAIME,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he’ll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city.",CERSEI,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen.",LADY OLENNA,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

  The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen’s safety.,KEVAN,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
"  You’ll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?",JAIME,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" No, but if the king should call on me --",KEVAN,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
"  The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen’s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?",JAIME,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they’ve done to your son.  Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?,CERSEI,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Of course I want him back.,KEVAN,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.,CERSEI,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" If it doesn’t go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We’ll have civil war. Many will die.",KEVAN,e4,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELORTOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are standing in the central chamber. TOMMEN lights a candle.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Is there no other way?,TOMMEN,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 You’re afraid for her?,HIGH SPARROW,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Of course I’m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.,TOMMEN,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 She’ll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn’t your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She’s truly opened her heart to them.,HIGH SPARROW,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 She’s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.,TOMMEN,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 And now she’s devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?,HIGH SPARROW,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
MARGAERY is sitting on a bench reading a book. The door opens. TOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are visible outside. TOMMEN enters and stares at MARGAERY. The HIGH SPARROW closes the door behind TOMMEN. MARGAERY sets down her book and stands. They embrace.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?,TOMMEN,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" No, Your Grace.",MARGAERY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

 We’ll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.,MARGAERY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?",MARGAERY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Yes, a few times. Have you?",TOMMEN,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Yes, I have. He’s not quite what we thought he was, is he?",MARGAERY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
TOMMEN scrunches up his face. MARGAERY chuckles and turns away.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 You think I’m mad. I sound mad.,MARGAERY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 He is. There’s something about him. His way of looking at the world. It’s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It’s taken me a while. He’s helped me.,MARGAERY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 What are you talking about? You’re a good person. You’ve always been a good person. You’re the best person I know.,TOMMEN,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
MARGAERY chuckles and retrieves her book from the bench.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.,TOMMEN,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I’ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories.",MARGAERY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 I don’t understand.,TOMMEN,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
MARGAERY rushes to TOMMEN and takes his hand.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 It’s all right. It really is. It’s such a relief to let go of those lies.,MARGAERY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
MARGAERY leads him to the bench and they sit down on it together.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 What about Loras?,TOMMEN,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don’t erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.",MARGAERY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 It’s hard to walk in this.,GILLY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

GILLY takes SAM’s arm and they walk down the hall together.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

 Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.,DICKON,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Oh, that’s a fair distance.",SAM,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 So do you do much hunting up at the wall?,DICKON,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don’t hunt, you don’t eat.",SAM,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?,DICKON,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" I imagine it’s common where you’re from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn’t it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.",MELESSA (to GILLY),e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.,TALLA,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 That’s enough of that.,RANDYLL,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Samwell, would you care for more bread?",MELESSA,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother.",SAM,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
A servant girl retrieves the basket of bread. She holds out the basket to SAM. SAM reaches for the bread.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

SAM waves the servant away.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

" Yes. And once I have my chain, I’ll return to Castle Black.",SAM,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 I thought the Night’s Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.,RANDYLL,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
SAM puts down his utensils.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I’ll wager you still can’t sit a horse or wield a sword.,RANDYLL,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Randyll, to be maester of the Night’s Watch is a great honor.",MELESSA,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.,GILLY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
DICKON laughs.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 There’s no such thing.,DICKON,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker’s heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He’s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.,GILLY,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How’d you come to meet my son?,RANDYLL,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

 North of the Wall? You’re a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?,RANDYLL,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
RANDYLL points to a blade mounted on a mantle beside the table.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" It’s called Heartsbane. It’s been in our family for 500 years. It’s Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It’s supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole’s Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn’t you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home.",RANDYLL,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

" Your mother’s a fine woman. You’re not worthy of her. To please her, I’ll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.",RANDYLL (to SAM),e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
GILLY is sitting at the foot of the bed. LITTLE SAM is in a crib beside her. SAM stands before them both. He hangs his head.,,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 I’m sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he’d turn you and Little Sam away.,SAM,e6,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

 I think we’ve had enough small talk. What are you here?,LYANNA,e7,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”,LYANNA,e7,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

" Go on, Ser Davos.",LYANNA,e7,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life.

" As long as I’m standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I’m ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?",BRYNDEN,e7,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
BRYNDEN walks past JAIME and continues back across the drawbridge.,,e7,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives. Why did you come to treat with me?,JAIME,e7,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
BRYNDEN turns back to face JAIME.,,e7,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

ROBETT laughs.,,e7,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 Then the rumors are true. I didn’t dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.,ROBETT,e7,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

ROBETT gets closer to SANSA.,,e7,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.,ROBETT,e7,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

I’m a man of mercy.",RAMSAY,e9,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

" All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?",JON SNOW,e9,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" We’ll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay’s claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won’t live long.",SANSA,e9,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

" If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?",SANSA,e9,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men!,JON SNOW,e9,season-06,Game-of-Thrones

 It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.,DAVOS,e9,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 You saw these demons?,TORMUND,e9,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
 What?,DAVOS,e9,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
They stop walking. DAVOS looks at TORMUND.,,e9,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" No, it’s a manner of speaking. Not actual demons.",DAVOS,e9,season-06,Game-of-Thrones
" Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn’t have demons in his skull. He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him.

" The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well.

  I did.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?",DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  They're hard to miss.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  But still, I need your help?",DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Not to defeat Cersei.  You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.  Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.",DAVOS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Almost.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  But you haven't stormed King's Landing.  Why not?  The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.  It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it.  Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.",DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair.",JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS turns to TYRION.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You told me you liked this man.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I do.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child.",DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I believe he's calling all of us children.  Figure of speech.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.",JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.",DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I am not your enemy.  The dead are the enemy.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS pauses and is incredulous.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The dead?,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS addresses TYRION.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Is that another figure of speech?,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON answers her before Tyrion.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The Army of the Dead is on the march.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The Army of the Dead?,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?",JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  No, I don't think you're either of those things.",TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The Army of the Dead is real.  The White Walkers are real.  The Knight King is real.  I've seen them.  If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON begins walking closer to the throne.  The Dothraki guards step towards him to halt him.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS pauses a moment.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I was born at Dragonstone.  Not that I can remember it.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS stands from the throne and begins walking down the stairs towards JON.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.  Robert was your father's best friend, no?  I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib.  Not that it matters now of course.  I spent my life in foreign lands.  So many men have tried to kill me.  I don't remember all of their names.  I have been sold like a brood mare.  I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.  Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?  Faith.  Not in any gods.  Not in myths and legends.  In myself.  In Daenerys Targaryen.  The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born.  The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea.  Any sea.",DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS stops walking and is face to face with JON.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  They did for me.  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.  And I will.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
Tyrion steps up to stand next to DAENERYS and speaks to JON.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The war against my sister has already begun.  You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION pauses a moment.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You don't believe him.  I understand that.  It sounds like nonsense.,DAVOS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON nods in agreement.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.  You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros.  He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen.  He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.  He was named King in the North.  Not because of his birthright.  He has no birthright.  He's a damn bastard.  All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him.",DAVOS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS stops looking at DAVOS and begins looking at JON.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things.  He fought those things for the good of his people.  He risked his life for his people.  He took a knife in the heart for his people.  He gave his own --",DAVOS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON looks at DAVOS to cut him off.  DAVOS stops talking.  DAENERYS and TYRION exchange glances.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die.  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.,DAVOS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON shakes his head and looks at the floor.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys.  Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  There's no time for that.  There's no time for any of this.  While we stand here debating --,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It takes no time to bend the knee.  Pledge your sword to her cause.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And why would I do that?,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON turns to speak to DAENERYS.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.  As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name.  And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.  The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them.  And I will continue to do so as well as I can.",JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  That's fair.  It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion.",DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
VARYS walks quickly into the throne room and approaches DAENERYS.  He begins whispering in her ear.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You must forgive my manners.  You will both be tired after your long journey.  We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS begins speaking Valyrian to her Queensguard.  Her guard steps forward to escort JON and DAVOS.  JON speaks to DAENERYS.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Am I your prisoner?,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Not yet.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS begins walking back to the throne.  JON and DAVOS exit the throne room with a member of the Queensguard.  The Dothraki close the door to the throne room after JON and DAVOS exit.  VARYS begins speaking to DAENERYS.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.,VARYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And?,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Two or three ships escaped.  The rest sunk our captured.  Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured.  The Greyjoys are dead or captured.,VARYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  All of them?,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  SEA OF DORNE,CUT TO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
Theon is hanging on to flotsam on the ocean.  A friendly Greyjoy ship is pulling him out of the water with a rope.  They haul him onto the ship and drop him on deck.  He is shivering and dishelveled.  The captain of the boat approaches THEON and speaks to him while THEON is laying on the deck.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Your sister's dead?,CAPTAIN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Euron has her.,THEON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You saw him take her?  And you got away?,CAPTAIN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I couldn't save her.  I tried.,THEON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You wouldn't be here if you tried.,CAPTAIN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"THEON turns his eyes away from the captain.  The captain turns and walks away.  The men go back to their duties, some stepping over THEON as he continues to lay on the deck.",,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"EURON is escorting prisoners YARA GREYJOY, ELLARIA and TYENE SAND.  The prisoners are chained.  EURON is riding a horse.  He has a rope tied to YARA's neck and is leading her towards the Red Keep.  There is a large crowd shouting and cheering as they bring the prisoners through the streets.  EURON is smiling and showing off for the crowd.  The crowd shouts obscenities and curses at the prisoners.",,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  This is the life.  Look at them.  Cheering for a Greyjoy.,EURON(to YARA),e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
EURON pulls on the rope around YARA's neck forcing her to run forward to stand next to EURON's horse.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I have to be honest, it's making me hard.  Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?",EURON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
EURON begins mocking Theon in a high pitched voice.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Oh no!,EURON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
EURON laughs.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What a twat.,EURON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"CERSEI is sitting on the throne surrounded by QYBURN, JAIME, and THE MOUNTAIN.  There is a crowd gathered and they're clapping as EURON brings the prisoners down the aisle towards the throne.  EURON climbs down from his horse and grabs the chains that bind ELLARIA and TYENE and starts walking them to the throne.",,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  My queen.  Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.,EURON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
EURON throws the chains at the feet of CERSEI.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I give you --,EURON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
EURON looks over to JAIME.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ELLARIA spits onto the floor near the throne and CERSEI smiles.  CERSEI begins speaking to EURON.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
EURON leans in and speaks to CERSEI so the crowd can't hear.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  A bit more than a true friend.,EURON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  There's only one reward I want.,EURON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You shall have what your heart desires --,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME looks over at CERSEI.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
CERSEI stands and addresses the people gathered in the throne room.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country.",CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
The crowd starts cheering and clapping.  CERSEI turns and walks back to the throne and sits.  EURON is waving to the crowd and begins speaking to JAIME.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  There's nothing quite like it, is there?  The love of the people.  I suppose you wouldn't know.",EURON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.",JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Or yours.  They just like severed heads really.  Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.",EURON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Advice?,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Does she like it gentle or rough?  A finger in the bum?,EURON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME turns to EURON angrily.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now.  We'll talk later.",EURON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
EURON bows to the queen.  He walks down and collects YARA and walks out with her and his guards.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"THE MOUNTAIN, CERSEI and QYBURN are standing in a torch lit dungeon beneath the Red Keep.  ELLARIA and TYENE are chained to walls opposite of each other.  They are both gagged.  CERSEI speaks to ELLARIA.",,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I want you to know I understand.  Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you.  I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.  I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.",CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ELLARIA struggles against her restraints,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  The sound of your scream.  I never heard a sound like that.  I thought, that's true love.  Oberyn looked beautiful that day.  He really did.  No one moved like him.  No one had such skill with a spear.  Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.  If only he hadn't taunted him.  He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.  But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?  Now he's burried somewhere.  And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever.  That must be difficult for you.  When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child.  I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse.  I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.  I never got to have a mother.  But Myrcella did.  She was mine and you took her from me.  Why did you do that?",CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
CERSEI pauses and looks at ELLARIA.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It doesn't matter now.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
CERSEI walks across the room and stands next to TYENE looking at her but continues speaking to ELLARIA.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Your daughter is a beauty too.  Brown eyes, those lips.  A perfect Dornish beauty.",CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"TYENE is looking from CERSEI to her mother, ELLARIA.  CERSAI stops looking at TYENE and turns back to ELLARIA.",,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I imagine she is your favorite.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ELLARIA pulls on her restraints.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites.  But still, we're only human.  We love who we love.",CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ELLARIA begins gasping and trying to speak through her gag.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I'm sorry.  I can't understand you.  The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying.  It must be frustrating.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ELLARIA whimpers.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  We all make our choices.  You chose to murder my daughter.  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ELLARIA screams and pulls against her restraints.  She takes the slack out of the chain but is held in place inches from CERSEI.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Do you feel powerful now?  I don't sleep very well, not at all really.  I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies.  How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.  I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.  It would be poetic I suppose but fast.  Too fast.",CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
CERSEI turns away from ELLARIA and walks back to TYENE and takes TYENE's face in her hands.  She continues talking to ELLARIA.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
CERSEI removes the gag from TYENE's mouth.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  She's so beautiful.  The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right.",CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"CERSEI is caressing TYENE's face.  CERSEI looks at ELLARIA, then turns back and kisses TYENE.  TYENE is whimpering.  CERSEI stops kissing TYENE and looks back at ELLARIA.",,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Momma!,TYENE,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ELLARIA screams and looks at CERSEI.  QYBURN steps to TYENE and puts the gag back on her mouth.  TYENE is crying.  QYBURN walks over to CERSEI and hands her a cloth.  ELLARIA falls down to her knees and is watching her daughter.  CERSEI starts wiping off the red lipstick she was wearing.  CERSEI speaks to ELLARIA.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know.  Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.  The long goodbye, was that it?",CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The Long Farewell.,QYBURN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
QYBURN hands CERSEI a vile containing the posion antidote.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  But death is certain?,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain.",QYBURN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ELLARIA is still on her knees crying.  CERSEI squats down to talk to her.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Your daughter will die here in this cell.  You will be here watching when she does.  You will be here the rest of your days.  If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat.  You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made.",CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
CERSEI continues looking at ELLARIA but speaks to QYBURN.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.  I don't want her to miss a thing.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
CERSEI stands and walks out of the chamber with her entourage.  TYENE and ELLARIA both strain against their chains but can't reach each other.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME sets his gold hand down on the table and pours himself a glass of wine.  CERSEI barges in and approaches him.  CERSEI starts kissing JAIME.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  No.,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
CERSEI kisses JAIME.  JAIME stands.  CERSEI unties his pants and gets on her knees.  Sex scene ensues.  Some time has passed.  CERSEI is asleep and JAIME is watching her in bed.  There's a knock at the door.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Don't.,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"CERSEI kisses JAIME, gets out of bed and covers herself with a robe.  JAIME sits up concerned.",,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What are you doing?  No one can see us like this ?,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  I'll do as I please.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
CERSEI walks over and opens the door.  A messenger looks in and sees JAIME in the bed.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Forgive me, Your Grace.  The visitor from Braavos has arrived.",MESSENGER,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Good.  And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  At once, Your Grace.",MESSENGER,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
CERSEI closes the door.  JAIME lays his head against his pillows and laughs nervously.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
CERSEI is pouring two glasses of wine.  She carries them over and offers one to TYCHO NESTORIS of the Iron Bank.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  No, thank you.",TYCHO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

"  My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son.  From all reports he was a fine young man.",TYCHO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Condolences and congratulations.  You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms.  That's quite an accomplishment.  The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.,TYCHO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Indeed.  But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.,TYCHO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The Iron Bank wants its gold back.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Your father never minced words either.  But, yes, your debts are considerable.  And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.  We both know how expensive war can be.",TYCHO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And we both know gold wins wars.  Your vaults are empty.  Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies.  You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.,TYCHO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  We don't make bets.  We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.,TYCHO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  That's a fancy way of saying bet.  The war has already begun.  I've drawn first blood.  I decapitated the Dornish snake.  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.,TYCHO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  For now.  Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons.  How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?,TYCHO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.  Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl.  You want to invest in her?  I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.  How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?",CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true.",TYCHO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch.  In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
TYCHO begins to speak but CERSEI cuts him off.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts.  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Your father's daughter indeed.,TYCHO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Give me a fortnight.  Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.,CERSEI,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION is walking along the cliffs and sees JON standing alone looking out into the ocean.  TYRION approaches JON and speaks to him.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.  You're making it difficult.  You look a lot better brooding than I do.  You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  I'm not playing word games with you.  The dead are coming for us all.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.",TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It's hard for me to fathom.  It really is.  If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON pauses and hangs his head.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You probably don't believe me.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I do actually.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You didn't before.  Grumpkins and snarks you called them.  Do you remember?  You said it was all nonsense.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  It was all nonsense.  Everybody knew it.  But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.",TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Good question.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I know it's a good question.  I'm looking for an answer.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  People's minds aren't made for problems that large.  White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.",TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.  I can't help them from here.  I'd like to leave.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.  Don't go south.  Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader.  And here I am.  A northern fool.",JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us.  And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye.  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't.  Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now.  While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter.  She protects people from monsters, just as you do.  That's why she came here.  And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting.  That's not a reasonable thing to ask.",TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON turns from TYRION and begins to walk away.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  So do you have anything reasonable to ask?,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON stops and turns back around.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What do you mean?,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Maybe you are a northern fool.  I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS and TYRION are having a discussion.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Dragonglass?,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Yes.  Volcanic glass, obsidian.  He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.",TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.",TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them.  I'm unsure of the nomenclature.",TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.",TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Which wise man said this?,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I don't remember.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I would never do that...to you.  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.  I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway.  You don't have to believe him.  Let him mine the Dragonglass.  If he's wrong it's worthless.  You didn't even know it was here.  It's nothing to you.  Give him something by giving him nothing.  Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally.  Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand.  Casterly Rock.",TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You must allow them their flights of fancy.  It's dreary in the north.,TYRION,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS is at the bottom of the path looking out into the ocean.  Dragons are flying over the ocean and over the mountains in the distance.  JON approaches DAENERYS from the top of the stairs.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Amazing thing to see.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS turns to look at JON.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You lost two brothers as well?,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON shakes his head.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are.  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You've been talking to Tyrion?,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  He is my Hand.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  He enjoys talking.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  We all enjoy what we're good at.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I don't.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS pauses and looks at JON.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I never expected that you would.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I haven't either.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it.  Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.,DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Thank you.,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS turns back to the ocean.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?,JON,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  You better get to work, Jon Snow.",DAENERYS,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON turns and quickly walks up the stairs towards the castly.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"Men are working in the courtyard rolling carts of hey and carrying water.  A blacksmith is working the forge.  SANSA, PETER BAELISH, YOHN ROYCE and MAESTER WOLKAN are standing on the upper level of the courtyard having a discussion.",,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  How much do we have?,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  4,000 bushels, My Lady.",WOLKAN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What does that mean?,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.",YOHN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA begins walking and everyone follows.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I'm not entirely certain.  I'll check Maester Llewyn's records.  He kept a copy of every raven scroll.,WOLKAN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA and the men walk from the upper level down into the courtyard.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell.",SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  No, My Lady, most likely not.",WOLKAN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  We must prepare for that eventuality.  Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be.  We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north.  If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.",SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Very wise, My Lady.",YOHN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?",SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
WOLKAN bows and leaves.  SANSA and the others keep walking through the courtyard.  SANSA sees smiths hammering breastplate.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Are they covering those breastplates in leather?,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  No, My Lady.",YOHN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?",SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  They should indeed.  Pardon me, My Lady.",YOHN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
YOHN steps over to the blacksmith.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  You there, why isn't there leather on these?",YOHN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA and BAELISH continue walking.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Command suits you.  The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.,BAELISH,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  So they should be.,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I know Cersei better than anyone here.  If you turn your back on her --,BAELISH,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I only meant to say --,BAELISH,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous?  Thank you for your wise council.",SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  One of two things will happen.  Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end.  Or life will win out.  And what then?",BAELISH,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
BAELISH walks in front of SANSA and stops her.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Don't fight in the north or the south.  Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind.  Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once.  Live that way and nothing will surprise you.  Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before.",BAELISH,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
A Winterfell guard approaches SANSA and BAELISH.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Lady Sansa, at the gate.",GUARD,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA turns and walks away from BAELISH.  There is a commotion at the gate.  People are gathered around.  SANSA rushes over to see what's going on.  Bran is in a cart in the Winterfell courtyard.  Bran looks at SANSA for a few moments without saying anything.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Hello, Sansa.",BRAN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA begins to cry and hugs BRAN.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA and BRAN are sitting next to the Weirwood Tree having a discussion.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I wish Jon was here.,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Yes.  I need to speak to him.,BRAN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Your father's last living true born son.  You're Lord of Winterfell.,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I can never be the Lord of Winterfell.  I can never be lord of anything.  I'm the three-eyed raven.,BRAN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I don't know what that means.,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It's difficult to explain.,BRAN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Try, please, for me.",SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  It means I can see everything.  Everything that's ever happened to everyone.  Everything that's happening right now.  It's all pieces, fragments.  I need to learn to see better.  When the long night comes again I need to be ready.",BRAN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  How do you know all of this?,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The three-eyed raven taught me.,BRAN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I thought you were the three-eyed raven.,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I told you it's difficult to explain.,BRAN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Bran --,SANSA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.  I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home.  It was so beautiful that night.  Snow falling just like now.  And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.,BRAN,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA appears shaken.  She quickly stands up to leave.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

JORAH puts on his shirt and begins tying it up.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

"  Interesting thing about my father.  He built our house up from near ruin.  He built our army.  He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers.  That was beneath him.  So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find.  Me.  He was right.  I was low.  The company I kept low, women mostly.  They weren't welcome at the Rock.  Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.  I couldn't walk them through the front gates.  I couldn't have them in my chambers.

The battle is over.  GREY WORM and other Unsullied soldiers are stepping over dozens of dead Lannisters on the battlements.  GREY WORM removes his helmet and one of his men speak in Valyrian.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  There are none left.,UNSULLIED 1,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  There are supposed to be more than this.  Many more.,GREY WORM,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
GREY WORM turns to look out from the battlements towards the ocean.  The Unsullied fleet is under attack from the Iron Fleet and many boats are sunk or in flames.  GREY WORM's face twists in anger.  GREY WORM steps down from the battlement and grabs a bleeding Lannister soldier.  GREY WORM begins speaking English.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Where are they?  Where are the rest of the Lannisters?,GREY WORM,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"Thousands of fully armored Lannister soldiers are marching towards Highgarden.  JAIME is riding his horse inspecting the lines of soldiers.  He rides over and joins BRONN, RANDYLL TARLEY and DICKON TARLEY.  The camera shifts focus to Lady Olenna who is watching the advancing army from a balcony in Highgarden.  She turns and walks back into her castle.",,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
Some time has passed.  The battle is already over.  JAIME is walking in the courtyard and there are dead Tyrell men scattered everywhere.  JAIME climbs to the top of the tower to meet OLENNA TYRELL.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  OLENNA'S QUARTERS,CUT TO,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
Olenna is sitting alone at a table wearing all black.  JAIME opens the door and enters the room.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It's done?,OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It is.,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And now the rains weep for our whores.  Did we fight well?,OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I suppose as well as can be expected.,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME walks to the wine and pours two glasses.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It was never our forte.  Golden roses indeed.  Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.,OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.  Well, it is to me.  My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.",JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  So you'll just let them take it?,OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  For now.  They won't be able to hold it.  Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left.  Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros.",JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME walks to where OLENNA is sitting and places both wine glasses on the table and sits down.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?",OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.  There are always lessons in failures.,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Yes.  You must be very wise by now.,OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  My father always said I was a slow learner.,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry?  I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.  No more learning from my mistakes, eh?  How will you do it?  With that sword?",OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME shakes his head no.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?  Not that he ever used it.  What did he call it?",OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Widow's Wail.,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  He really was a cunt, wasn't he?  I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders.  I never lost a night's sleep over them.  They were necessary.  And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did.  But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining.  That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination.  She's a monster, you do know that?",OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  To you, sure.  To others as well.  But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?",JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You love her.  You really do love her.  You poor fool.  She'll be the end of you.,OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Possibly.  Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?",JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What better person to discuss it with?  What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?  But perhaps you're right.  If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.,OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Yes, it has.",JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  She's a disease.  I regret my role in spreading it.  You will too.,OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I think we're done here.,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME stands up and moves closer to OLENNA.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  How will it happen?,OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.  I talked her out of those.,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
OLENNA looks up at JAIME.  JAIME produces a small vial from a pouch on his belt and pops the cork off with his thumb.  He pours the contents of the vial into one of the glasses of wine and slides it in front of OLENNA.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Will there be pain?,OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  No.  I made sure of that.,JAIME,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  That's good.,OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
OLENNA reaches out and takes the wine.  She drinks the entire cup.  She looks back to JAIME.,,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple.  It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father.  It was horrible enough for me.  A shocking scene.  Not at all what I intended.  You see, I'd never seen the posion work before.  Tell Cersei.  I want her to know it was me.",OLENNA,e3,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  There is still the question of my prize.,BRONN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  That's a lot of money I just gave you.,JAIME,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It's not a castle.,BRONN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
BRONN turns and points to Highgarden.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  How about that one?  It's available.,BRONN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

"  Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?  All your new riches weighing you down?",BRONN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  They're not mine.  The gold belongs to the Iron Bank.  We pay our debts.,JAIME,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Right.  Just not to me.,BRONN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid.

JAIME looks over to BRONN.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?",JAIME,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I'm not much for shoveling weight.,BRONN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

CERSEI and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.  I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.",TYCHO,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  You're too kind, My Lord.",CERSEI,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace.  I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.  And the current arithmetic is outstanding.  The gold --",TYCHO,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Is on its way.  My brother is supervising its transportation himself.,CERSEI,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.  They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.,TYCHO,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  We must devise a way to raise their spirits.,CERSEI,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Yes.  Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.,TYCHO,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.,CERSEI,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I see a great deal of potential in that venture.  I imagine that it would require outside investment?,TYCHO,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  It will indeed.  I need to expand my armies, my navies.  My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.",CERSEI,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  Do you know who this belonged to?,BRAN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  No.  That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.  In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.  Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.  I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.",BAELISH,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
BAELISH hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN.  BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

ARYA turns to look at SANSA.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  He's declared for House Stark.,SANSA,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Why would he give you a dagger?,SANSA,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  He thought I'd want it.,BRAN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Why?,SANSA,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Because it was meant to kill me.,BRAN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The cutthroat after your fall?,SANSA,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?,ARYA,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.,BRAN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  He's not a generous man.  He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.,SANSA,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It doesn't matter.,BRAN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What do you mean it doesn't matter?,SANSA,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I don't want it.,BRAN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
BRAN holds the knife out to ARYA.  ARYA looks at BRAN.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Are you sure?  It's Valyrian steel.,ARYA,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It's wasted on a cripple.,BRAN,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ARYA looks down at the dagger.  She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ARYA is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them.  The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell.  Men are milling around doing various jobs.  BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Catelyn Stark would be proud.  You kept your vow.,PODRICK,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I did next to nothing.,BRIENNE,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  You're too hard on yourself, My Lady.",PODRICK,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  Soon.  They will come back to me.,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  He better.,MISSANDEI,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI.  She then continues walking.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What happened?,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
MISSANDEI begins smirking.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Many things.,MISSANDEI,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Many things?,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
Jon Snow appears at the bottom of the path.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Your Grace.,JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard.  She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It's all right.,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON.  They walk along the beach until they reach a cave.  DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.,JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave.  He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls.  He continues walking deeper into the cave.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  So this is it, all we'll ever need.",JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.",JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave.  There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The Children of the Forest made these.,JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  When?,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  A very long time ago.,JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.  Maybe even before there were men.,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  No.,JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON.  JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals.  The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  They were here together the Children and the First Men.,JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Doing what?  Fighting each other?,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall.  There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  They fought together against their common enemy.  Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together.  We need to do the same if we're going to survive.",DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Because the enemy is real.  It's always been real.,JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS turns to look at JON.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  No, I don't think I can.",JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS steps forward closer to JON.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I will fight for you.  I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered.",JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  They will if their king does.  They chose you to lead them.  They chose you to protect them.  Isn't their survival more important than your pride?,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"JON and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave.  As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them.  DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion.",,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What is it?,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  We took Casterly Rock.,TYRION,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  That's very good to hear.,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION and VARYS look at each other.  They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Isn't it?,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
The group are all walking along the beach.  Daenerys is displeased.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.  Perhaps --,DAVOS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You will stay.  All my allies are gone.  They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  We still have the largest army.,TYRION,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.  Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.  We have a plan.  It's still the right plan.,TYRION,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"DAENERYS stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion.",,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  The right plan?  Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.",DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  If I've underestimated our enemies --,TYRION,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Our enemies?  Your family, you mean.  Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.",DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS begins looking out to the ocean.  Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Enough with the clever plans.,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS turns back and looks at TYRION.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  We've discussed this.,TYRION,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  A smart one.,TYRION,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS looks over to JON SNOW.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What do you think I should do?,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I would never presume to --,JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

DAENERYS begins walking close to JON.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What do you think I should do?,DAENERYS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I never thought that dragons would exist again.  No one did.  The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.  Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.  Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.,JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON glances back towards the dragons.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different.  You're just more of the same.",JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

BRIENNE chuckles.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?",ARYA,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
BRIENNE nods her head in agreement.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  I won't cut you.  Don't worry.,ARYA,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
BRIENNE smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I'll try not to.,BRIENNE,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"BRIENNE strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack.  BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling.  ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword.  BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA.  BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony.  ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back.  BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt.  BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground.  ARYA quickly gets back to her feet.  BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground.  BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck.  BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling.",,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Who taught you to do that?,BRIENNE,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  No one.,ARYA,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ARYA collects her sword.  SANSA walks away.  BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him.  BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  A good heart?  I've noticed you starring at that good heart.,DAVOS,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.,MISSANDEI,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You believe that?,JON,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

They switch from a seated position to standing atop their saddles shooting bow and arrow.  The Lannister archers fire back and many men are killed.  DAENERYS and DROGON circle around and billow flames across the battlefield.  DAENERYS steers DROGON down the King's Road.  DROGON spews flames and destroys the carriages along the road.  Carts are exploding into pieces, barrels are flying through the air.  JAIME is looking at the carnage in astonishment.",,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

The archers fire their arrows in unison.  DAENERYS sees the projectiles and turns Drogon so the arrows bounce harmlessly off his breast.  She makes a run on another line of carriages and DROGON burns them in a single breath.  Men are screaming and catching on fire.  JAIME and BRONN survey the damage.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

"A Dothraki screamer wielding two swords charges JAIME.  JAIME is blocking the attacks but is getting overpowered.  DICKON stabs the screamer through his back.  JAIME nods at DICKON.  BRONN is making his way to the crossbow.  A Dothraki screamer sees him and charges.  BRONN reaches behind him and retrieves a small sword.  He throws the sword at the Dothraki but the screamer parries it.  BRONN draws his primary sword and the two men charge at each other.  As BRONN is about to strike, the screamer leans over and cuts BRONN's horse's leg off causing BRONN to fall to the ground.  BRONN's bag of gold hits the ground and splits open.  The screamer is turning his horse around and is about to attack BRONN again.  BRONN abandons the gold and runs into the mayhem trying to lose the mounted rider.  BRONN pushes a flaming Lannister soldier out of the way.  He pulls a sword out of a dead man and uses it to start fighting Dothraki.  DROGON flies overhead and spews flames through the air.  BRONN manages to escape the mounted rider and disappear into the fog.  The screamer dismounts and continues the search on foot.  The screamer climbs onto a covered wagon to check for BRONN.  When he pulls the canvas back he see's BRONN behind the crossbow with a bolt pointed at him.  BRONN fires the bolt and impales the Dothraki screamer.  BRONN pulls a lever and the sides of the wagon drop down revealing the crossbow.  BRONN reloads the weapon and begins making adjustments to line up a shot on DROGON.",,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

TYRION is watching the mayhem.  Men are screaming and engulfed in flames.  Horses and carriages run wild with no driver.  JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde.  Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces.  Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire.  DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water.  JAIME sees her approaching his position.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

DROGON spits flames into the Lannister position.  The men standing there are reduced to standing ash.  The wind blows them away.  BRONN is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow.  He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire.  A bolt sails past DROGON and misses.  BRONN reloads the machine.  DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow.  BRONN takes his time aiming his shot.,,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

"Before DROGON can send flames, BRONN fires a bolt that strikes DROGON in the wing.  DROGON begins to pinwheel out of control towards the ground.  BRONN is smiling.  He whips the machine around and begins reloading.  DAENERYS and DROGON are falling from the sky.  DROGON regains control and begins hovering over the river.  BRONN realizes he doesn't have time to reload and dives out of the way of the incoming dragonfire.  DROGON spits flames at the machine and instantly destroys it.  Flames lick over BRONN but he is uninjured.  DROGON is forced to land on the edge of the river due to his wound.  DAENERYS climbs from her mount and rushes to pull the spear from DROGON's wing.  JAIME is 100 yards from DAENERYS watching her.  She is all alone.  JAIME sees a spear sticking out of a dead man.  TYRION spots JAIME across the battlefield.",,e4,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

"JAIME is getting close.  DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand.  DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames.  BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire.  Their horses are instantly burned to death.

DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face.  DROGON creeps closer until he is inches  from JON.  JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON.  DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him.  DAENERYS  looks surprised and steps down from her mount.  DROGON turns and flies away.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

They arrive at The Wall at Eastwatch-by-the-sea and continue over the Wall.  The ravens fly many miles over tundra and more mountains.  The birds crest a hill and thousands of dead men can be seen marching south.  A group of riders and the Night King are on top of an outcrop watching the dead file past.  As the ravens approach the Night King peers in their direction and the birds scatter and disperse.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  I let him through the Wall years ago.  I saw him go beyond the wall.,SAMWELL,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And?,MARWYN,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.,MAESTER 1,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.,MARWYN,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SAMWELL steps forward and clears his throat.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.  If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it.  If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it.  And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good.",SAMWELL,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It could be done.  And this news could be authentic.  It's possible.  It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.,MARWYN,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.,MAESTER 1,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Archmaester, please.  It's real.  I've seen it.",SAMWELL,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.,MAESTER 1,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

VARYS and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone.  VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone.  TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  All rulers demand that people bend the knee.  It's why they're rulers.  She gave Tarley a choice.  A man who had taken up arms against her.  What else could she do?,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Not burn him alive alongside his son.,VARYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I am her hand, not her head.  I can't make her decisions for her.",TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  That's what I used to tell myself about her father.  I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive.  I was only a purveyor of information.,VARYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"VARYS reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it.  He grimaces as he drinks.",,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it.""",VARYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
VARYS drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION.  TYRION picks it up.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Daenerys is not her father.,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And she never will be... with the right counsel.  You need to find a way to make her listen.,VARYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Who is that for?,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Jon Snow.,VARYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Did you read it?,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.,VARYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What's it say?,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Nothing good.,VARYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS and VARYS are seated at the painted table.  TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen.  DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table.  JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I thought Arya was dead.  I thought Bran was dead.,JON,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I'm happy for you.  You don't look happy.,DAENERYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch.  If they make it past the wall --,JON,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years.  Presumably --,VARYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON interrupts VARYS.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I need to go home.,JON,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You said you don't have enough men.,DAENERYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  We'll fight with the men we have.  Unless you'll join us.,JON,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away she marches in.,DAENERYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Perhaps not.  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.  What if we prove her wrong?,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.,JON,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION begins walking around the table closer to JON.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  So bring the dead to her.,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.,DAENERYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  We don't have to bring the whole army.  Only one soldier.,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Is that possible?,DAVOS(to JON),e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.,JON,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.,VARYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The only person she listens to is Jaime.  He may listen to me.,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And how would you get into King's Landing.,DAENERYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
Everyone in the room stops and looks at DAVOS.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.",DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION nods his head.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men.",DAENERYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Fair point.  How do you propose to find one?,VARYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JON pauses and stares at the ground.  JORAH breaks the silence.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.,JORAH,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS turns to look at JORAH.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.  Allow me to serve you.,JORAH,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The free folk will help us.  They know the real north better than anyone.,JON,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  They won't follow Ser Jorah.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  They won't have to.,JON,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You can't lead a raid beyond the wall.  You're not in the Night's Watch anymore.  You're King in the North.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I'm the only one here whose fought them.  I'm the only one here who knows them.,JON,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I haven't given you permission to leave.,DAENERYS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.  I am a king.  And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.  I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.  Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance.",JON,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"Northen lords including ROBETT GLOVER, YOHN ROYCE and LYANNA MORMONT are congregated in the Great Hall.  ARYA walks into the room and hears a loud discussion.  The lords are adressing SANSA who is seated at the head table.",,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  The King in the North should stay in the north.  We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have.",ROBETT,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
The men agree in unison.  YOHN ROYCE stands up and walks in front of SANSA.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.",YOHN,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king.  He is doing what he thinks is best.",SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
The men sit down and everyone in the hall begins talking to one another.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I warned Jon this would happen.  He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.,SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  He didn't.  He trusted you to hold it for him.,ARYA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Well, he's not making it easy.  The northern lords are proud.",SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
The girls arrive at SANSA's quarters.  ARYA is glancing around the room.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  These are mother and father's chambers.,ARYA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And?,SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Nothing.,ARYA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Don't do that.,SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA turns around to face ARYA.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What?,ARYA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Say what you mean.,SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You always liked nice things.  It made you feel better than everyone.,ARYA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Are you angry with me?,SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.,ARYA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.",SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Their opinions are important to you?,ARYA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Glover has 500 men.  Royce has 2,000.  Offend them and Jon loses his army.",SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Not if they lose their heads first.,ARYA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.  We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together.  Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together.",SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want.",ARYA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  How can you even think such a horrible thing?,SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  You're thinking it right now.  You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away.",ARYA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I have work to do.,SANSA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA turns and walks away from ARYA.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  My lady.,ARYA,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ARYA exits the room.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAVOS and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing.  DAVOS is securing a small row boat.  TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION turns to look at DAVOS.  DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.  The guards hardly ever patrol it.  Too many steps.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION begins walking towards the path.  DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead.  TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You're not staying here?,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What if someone takes the boat?,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Then we're fucked.  Best hurry.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
BRONN and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls.  Both men have sparring swords in their hand.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  We don't have time for this.  We should be preparing the city for a siege.  The Dothraki are coming.,JAIME,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  All the more reason for you to train.  Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.,BRONN,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.,JAIME,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  And here I am ready to train.,BRONN,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Why down here?,JAIME,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.,BRONN,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Today might be the day I kill you by accident.,JAIME,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.",BRONN,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
BRONN stops walking and holds his torch out.  TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME.  JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I'll leave you to it.,BRONN,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
BRONN turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME remains silent and stares at TYRION.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  You made me look like a complete fool.  I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me.  You abandoned the family home.  Completely unsentimental.  Father would have been proud.",TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Don't talk about our father.,JAIME,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Listen to me --,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.,JAIME,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME shakes his head and says nothing.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  He was going to execute me.  He knew I was innocent.  He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am.  The little monster sent to punish him.  Do you think I wanted to be born this way?  Did he think I chose --",TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What do you want?,JAIME,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Daenerys will win this war.  You're a military man.  You must know there is no way around it.  Daenerys is not her father.  She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.,JAIME,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
Men are in the market selling their wares.  A blacksmith sharpens a sword on a grinding wheel.  DAVOS is walking through the market glancing around.  A man in a blacksmith shop pulls a sword from the fire and begins to hammer it on his anvil.  DAVOS walks into the shop.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I wasn't sure I'd find you.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"The blacksmith puts the sword down and turns around, revealing GENDRY, the bastard son of Robert Baratheon.",,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I thought you might still be rowing.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
GENDRY chuckles and DAVOS smiles.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.  I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.",DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?,GENDRY,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I haven't been here in years.  Why should they recognize me?  Sometimes I hardly do.  Nothing fucks you harder than time.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"DAVOS walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords.  He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place.  He turns back to GENDRY.",,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Anybody give you any trouble?,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Here I am arming Lannisters.  I never get a second look.  You were right.  Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.,GENDRY,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Don't be so sure.  Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.  Bad things are coming.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
GENDRY nods.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You came to get me.  You want me to come with you.,GENDRY,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I think you need to understand --,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I'm ready.  Let's go.,GENDRY,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You should know what you're heading into.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father?  They tried to kill me.,GENDRY,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
GENDRY is tossing his tools and apron to the side.  He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I've been getting ready.  I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.",GENDRY,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You might want to bring one of those swords.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
GENDRY smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --",GENDRY,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
GENDRY removes a giant war hammer from the wall.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
GENDRY and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAVOS and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Keep your father's name to yourself.  The situation is complicated enough already.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
GENDRY and DAVOS arrive at the boat.  GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo.  DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope.  Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Who should I say I am?,GENDRY,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAVOS turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat.  He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --",DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  You there.,GUARD 1,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
Both guards have their hands on their weapons ready to draw.  DAVOS starts walking towards the guards and spreads his cloak open.  GENDRY remains by the boat.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  No weapons, friends.  I promise.  What can I do for you?",DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Is that your boat?,GUARD 1,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  It is.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
GENDRY looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  The docks are that way.,GUARD 2,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  That they are.  I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.,GENDRY,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
The two guards look at each other and chuckle.  DAVOS retrieves a coin purse and opens it.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Still five gold dragons?,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Are you joking?,GUARD 1,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  Apiece.,GUARD 1,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAVOS angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAVOS turns and begins walking back to his boat.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What's in the boat?,GUARD 1,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAVOS pauses and turns back to the guards.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Not more gold.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Wine?,GUARD 2,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  I like wine.,GUARD 2,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Or hams.,GUARD 1,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Come and have a look.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"The guards walk over to the boat.  As they approach, DAVOS walks to the boat and pulls a cover to reveal the cargo.  As he pulls back the canvas, he throws it over GENDRY's exposed weapon covering it from view.  There are several baskets of fermented meat.  The guards twist their faces in disgust.",,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Fermented crab.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  What?,GUARD 2,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Fermented crab.  One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week.  A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.  Five minutes later, he's back in the race.  Here, have a taste.",DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAVOS scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards.  Both men reach out and take a pinch.  The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth.  They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
The guards and DAVOS laugh.  The guards turn and start walking back towards the city.  GENDRY nods at them as they go.  TYRION appears at the top of the stairs leading to the beach.  The Goldcloaks see him as he's walking down the path.  TYRION walks by the guards and they exchange glances.  The guards stop and turn back toward the boat.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"  Oi, Dwarf!",GUARD 2,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAVOS quickly walks to cut the guards off.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  That dwarf --,GUARD 2,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
The guards blow past DAVOS and begin talking to TYRION.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Where did you get that scar?,GUARD 1,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Fish hook.  Some men you just can't teach.,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.,GUARD 2,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAVOS is still standing behind the guards.  He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Perhaps there's some arrangement?,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
The two guards turn back to DAVOS.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Arrangement?  You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?,GUARD 2,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
"GENDRY can be seen behind the backs of the guards.  He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2.  He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guard's head.  The man drops.  As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face.",,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
DAVOS is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  This is Gendry.,DAVOS,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  He'll do.,TYRION,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
The men grab onto the boat and begin to push it into the water.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME opens the door and step into the queen's room.  CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  That won't be necessary.,CERSEI,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
QYBURN bows his head and walks to leave the room.  As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Ser Jaime.,QYBURN,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
QYBURN closes the door as he leaves.  JAIME and CERSEI are alone.  CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.,,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  Why was QYBURN here?,JAIME,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
  He's Hand of the Queen.  Why are you here?,CERSEI,e5,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

  I hate that he died that way.  My father was the most honorable man I ever met.  He was good all the way through.  And he died on the executioner's block.,JON,e6,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn't very good.  Finally I hit the bullseye.  It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.  I don't remember.  But I hit the bullseye and I heard this.",ARYA,e6,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
ARYA starts a slow clap.,,e6,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

 Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.,BRONN,e7,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
" Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk.",TYRION,e7,season-07,Game-of-Thrones
" I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater.

 This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.,JON,e7,season-07,Game-of-Thrones

"SANDOR returns, bearing the crate on his back. He puts it down, removes the chains and bars that lock it. He removes the lid, and stands back in caution, grasping the hilt of his sword. Nothing happens. He kicks over the crate to reveal the WIGHT, who charges towards CERSEI, screeching horribly. SANDOR follows, while the WIGHT reaches for the frozen CERSEI. At the last minute, SANDOR pulls the chain that binds him, yanking the WIGHT off of its feet.  JAIME and the MOUNTAIN stand to protect CERSEI. The WIGHT turns its attention to SANDOR. He draws his sword, and slices the WIGHT in half as it attacks him. Both halves of the WIGHT continue to move. The upper half crawls towards SANDOR, who slices away a forearm.

YARA is still tied to the post in the cabin and looks up when she hears a bang. Suddenly, a body falls through the door with an axe in his face. THEON GREYJOY walks in after it, retrieves the axe and unties YARA. THEON helps YARA to her feet before she turns to him and headbutts him. THEON falls to the floor, stunned, and YARA extends a hand. THEON grabs her hand and they both exit the cabin.",,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

 Daenerys went north.,THEON,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

 You're my queen. I go where you command.,THEON,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

 And our queen is grateful.,TYRION,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.",DAVOS,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

 I'm not that old.,TYRION,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION looks up at VARYS and then at DAVOS.,,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Not as old as him.,TYRION,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
DAVOS chuckles.,,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

 What do I hold onto?,JON,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Whatever you can.,DAENERYS,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"JON grabs onto the dragon, which then proceeds to lift off whilst chittering. DAENERYS watches and smiles, before leaning forwards, cuing DROGON to follow suit. The dragons continue to fly higher, RHAEGAL turns side-to-side causing JON to yell out. They fly over the soldiers outside Winterfell and past TYRION, DAVOS and VARYS who are standing at the castle wall, staring in disbelief as they watch. DROGON flies ahead of RHAEGAL and continues higher before nosediving; RHAEGAL follows after his brother. They continue calmly before reaching a canyon, where the dragons dive straight down, before flying along the canyon floor. Once out of the canyon, RHAEGAL turns off, so DAENERYS instructs DROGON to do the same. She lands down next to JON. JON and DAENERYS, now dismounted from their dragons, walk together away from the dragons.",,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You've completely ruined horses for me.,JON,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

 It's cold up here for a southern girl.,JON,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 So keep your queen warm.,DAENERYS,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
JON pulls her in and kisses her. The dragons start to growl softly causing JON to pull away.,,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Don't be afraid.,DAENERYS,e1,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

 Your sister pledged to send her army north.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 She did.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me.",DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION looks up at his brother and JAIME looks back.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS turned her glare towards TYRION.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.",JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" ""We""?",DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION steps forwards towards DAENERYS.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Your Grace, I know my brother-",TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Like you knew your sister?,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?",TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat.",DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION looks to JON and SANSA.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours.",SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again.",JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 The things we do for love.,BRAN,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"DAENERYS, SANSA and JON all turn slowly to look at BRAN who sits to the side of SANSA. JAIME looks at him and BRAN maintains eye-contact.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 So why have you abandoned your house and family now?,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Because this goes beyond loyalty.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"He looks around to see BRIENNE, then turns back.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 This is about survival.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION turns to look at DAENERYS. BRIENNE then stands up.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" You don't know me well, Your Grace.",BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
She walks from behind her table to stand in the middle of the Hall beside JAIME.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it.",BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
She then addresses SANSA.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.",BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA looks down and then back up at BRIENNE.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You vouch for him?,SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I do.,BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You would fight beside him?,SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I would.,BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay.",SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 What does the Warden of the North say about it?,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
She turns to JON who sighs.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 We need every man we can get.,JON,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
The room falls silent as DAENERYS thinks to herself.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Very well.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"TYRION exhales sharply in relief. GREY WORM picks up JAIME’s sword, walks over to him, handing it over aggressively.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Thank you, Your Grace.",JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"DAENERYS stands up and the rest of the room does as she does. SANSA exits. DAENERYS turns to JON who exits after his sister. DAENERYS then exits followed by TYRION, VARYS, JORAH and MISSANDEI. JAIME then catches BRIENNE’s eye as she leaves and then he ends up looking at BRAN again who mimics his stare.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 WINTERFELL – HALLWAY,CUT TO,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"DAENERYS walks along the hallway outside the hall followed by TYRION, VARYS and JORAH.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.",DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I was a fool.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Not for the first time.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS stops walking and turns to TYRION.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can.",DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS exits. TYRION turns to VARYS and JORAH.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"Men chatter indistinctly as they forge the weapons. GENDRY walks into frame, dumping dragonglass out of a bucket. He then walks up to furnace and pulls out some dragonglass, moulding it and then dousing it in a bucket of water. ARYA STARK walks towards him. As the steam rises from the bucket she catches his eye.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Don't you have something better to do?,GENDRY,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You make my weapon yet?,ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.,GENDRY,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
GENDRY hands her a small axe with a blade made of dragonglass.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.,ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
GENDRY grabs the axe and brings it down harshly on a wooden stump.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 It's strong enough.,GENDRY,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"GENDRY moves to a pile of dragonglass spearheads and checks on it, ARYA follows.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know.",GENDRY,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Are you going to be down in the crypt?,ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" No, but-",GENDRY,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 But you're a fighter.,ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
He glances up at her.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I've done my share.,GENDRY,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You've fought them?,ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I did. Some of them.,GENDRY,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 How many?,ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 A few. That was enough.,GENDRY,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 What are they like?,ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Bad. Really bad.,GENDRY,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" ""Really bad""?",ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
She walks behind him and around the other side of the table so she is facing him.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?",ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-This is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like.",GENDRY,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"ARYA picks up one of the spearheads, turning it in her hand.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I know Death.,ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"She throws the spearhead, narrowly missing a blacksmith’s head. GENDRY exhales, staring in disbelief at the dragonglass impaled on the wooden beam.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 He's got many faces.,ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
She tosses another landing next to the first. The blacksmith quickly runs away. GENDRY slowly turns back to ARYA who picks up a third spearhead.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I look forward to seeing this one.,ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
She throws it and it lands with the first two. GENDRY chuckles to himself and ARYA walks back round the table and past GENDRY.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 My weapon?,ARYA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I'll get right on it.,GENDRY,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
ARYA walks off as GENDRY watches. He smirks to himself.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
The camera pans from behind a tree to show BRAN sitting in his wheelchair facing the weirwood tree. JAIME walks towards him. He stops a couple feet from him and looks down.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I'm sorry for what I did to you.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
BRAN turns his head towards JAIME.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.,BRAN,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME walks around in front of BRAN.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I'm not that person anymore.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark.",BRAN,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You're not?,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 No. I'm something else now.,BRAN,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You're not angry at me.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I'm not angry at anyone.,BRAN,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Why didn't you tell them?,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.,BRAN,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME nods and raises an eyebrow.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 What about afterwards?,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 How do you know there is an afterwards?,BRAN,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME stares at BRAN.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
All of the northerners are busy building defences in preparation for the army of the dead as TYRION walks past. JAIME approaches him.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Well, here we are.",TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Yes, here we are.",JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Together again.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
A man standing above them clears his throat and then spits on the floor beside them.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 And the masses rejoice.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 How do they feel about their new queen?,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 She's your new queen too.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
They start walking together.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 And she is? Different?,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 She is.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You're sure about her?,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I am.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 She didn't seem sure about you.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Hmm.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
They stop walking and TYRION turns to look up at JAIME.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Was she lying about the baby too?,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" No, that part is real.",JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION thinks to himself and they both start walking again.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
They start to walk up a staircase and TYRION turns to look at JAIME.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 What?,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.",TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"TYRION walks ahead as JAIME remains in the same spot. After a couple seconds, he follows. They both walk along the walls of castle looking over the courtyard.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I would've chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-",TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 A girl's mouth around-,BOTH,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Your cock.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 My cock.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
TYRION smiles up at JAIME.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
JAIME notices something whilst TYRION continues to talk and walks off.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.,TYRION,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"TYRION glances up where JAIME was and notices he is gone, he looks behind to see JAIME looking over the wall. The camera cuts to show BRIENNE walking outside the walls among the Unsullied.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,CUT TO,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"GREY WORM is seen testing out the traps around the castle as other Unsullied and northerners work around him. JAIME walks out the front gate. We see PODRICK PAYNE training with a soldier as BRIENNE watches on, smiling proudly. JAIME stands next to her and she glances at him.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Ser Jaime.,BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Lady Brienne.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
"PODRICK blocks the soldier and pushes him back, bettering him. They continue to fight with their swords.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 He's come a long way.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 He's all right. Still has a lot to learn.,BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
BRIENNE starts walking away and JAIME follows.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" I am. It's, uh-It's good ground.",BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 It is.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" The rise, it should give us some advantage.",BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
They stop walking.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back.",BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Yes, I think you're right.",JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
BRIENNE quickly turns to face JAIME.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 What are you doing?,BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 What?,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I think you know.,BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I truly don't.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.,BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You want me to insult you?,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 No!,BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Good.,JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
He pauses.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me.",JAIME,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
BRIENNE goes silent and looks down briefly. She returns his gaze.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I better get back.,BRIENNE,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

 Many things.,JORAH,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Long ago and long forgiven.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

" When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.",DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You made the right choice.,JORAH,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.,JORAH,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
JORAH chuckles.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 But the mind behind all those words-,JORAH,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.,JORAH,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

"ROYCE looks at SANSA who nods, granting him leave. ROYCE walks towards DAENERYS, bows and then exits. DAENERYS turns to watch him leave before turning back.",,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone.",SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.,SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
She starts walking towards SANSA.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei.",DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 You never should have either.,SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I thought he knew his sister.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Families are complicated.,SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Ours certainly have been.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
They both sit down in the seats SANSA and ROYCE were previously occupying.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 A sad thing to have in common.,SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell.",DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA returns her uneasy smile.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother.",DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" He loves you, you know that.",SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 That bothers you.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.,SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" All my life, I've known one goal: the Iron Throne. Taking it back from the people who destroyed my family, and almost destroyed yours. My war was against them. Until I met Jon. Now I'm here, half a world away, fighting Jon's war alongside him. Tell me, who manipulated whom?",DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
SANSA scoffs; she then leans forward and places her hand on DAENERYS’ hand.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.,SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS places her other hand on top of SANSA’s.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about.",DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Who was the first?,SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Someone taller.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
They both chuckle with one another.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?",SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I take the Iron Throne.,DAENERYS,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
" What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?",SANSA,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
DAENERYS removes her hand and looks away from SANSA. MAESTER WOLKAN enters the library.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

 My queen.,THEON,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

JAIME sighs and looks over at TYRION who is still standing to the side of the room with his wine. TORMUND grabs a wooden chair and places it with his back to the fire so that he is facing JAIME and BRIENNE. He sits down and leans forwards.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 I killed a giant when I was 10. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.,TORMUND,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

He points to the wall he’s leaning against. BERIC chuckles and holds his hand out. SANDOR passes him the drink. ARYA stands up and starts walking away from them.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
 Where are you going?,SANDOR,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones
ARYA turns around to look at them.,,e2,season-08,Game-of-Thrones

TYRION gives JON a look that demands that JON come to his own reckoning of DAENERYS's slaughter of King's Landing. JON's sorrowful visage is weighed by the gravity of the situation. He watches GREY WORM lead TYRION away. JON turns back to look at DAENERYS. She is both transcendent and horrible. She sees JON's inner conflict, and chooses to let him think.

He looks up at the Red Keep as he walks, approaching a passageway that leads to the Keep. As he approaches the passage, the large pile before him cracks, then undulates and expands. It is Drogon, wakened from slumber. The blanket of snow that enveloped him falls away. The dragon growls and extends himself to smell JON, who stands motionless before the great beast.

A rumbling growl builds as Drogon bares his teeth at JON. He rears back, screeching and whistling, then turns to the sky for a deafening roar.
